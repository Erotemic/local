Command-module for **command memory**
============================================================================

This module offers voice-commands for *remembering* and *repeating* 
previous recognitions.  This works just as well for *text* recognitions 
(such as "hello world!") and *command*


Commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following voice commands are available:

Command: **"repeat [last] [<n>] (commands | command) [<count> times]"**
    Repeats the *<n>* most recent recognitions.  If *<count>* is also 
    spoken, the series of recognitions is repeated that many times.

Command: **"remember [last] [<n>] (commands | command) as <name>"**
    Remembers the *<n>* most recent recognitions under the name *<name>*.
    The remember of recognitions can be repeated by simply saying
    **"<name>"**.

Command: **"start recording <name>"**
    Starts remembering recognitions and stores them under the name *<name>*.
    The user must speak **"stop recording"** later.  After that all the
    recognitions heard between start and stop commands can be repeated by
    simply saying **"<name>"**.

Command: **"stop recording"**
    Stops remembering recognitions.

Command: **"<memory> [<count> times]"**
    Plays back the series of recognitions previously remembered under 
    the spoken *<name>*.  If *<count>* is also spoken, the series of 
    recognitions is repeated that many times.
