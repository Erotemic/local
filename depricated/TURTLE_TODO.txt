Filter by left side images

Ensure encounter are matches
* encounters are in folders

for each of the 120 images, if you ran that against the database 
can do turtle viewpoints with tags


* For each encounter, query (left) images from each encounter vs all non left encounters (name accuracy)

* For each encounter, query (left + right) in encounter vs all left+right non encounters (name accuracy)

* For each annotation (qpername=1), query against all non-encounters with [dpername=1,2,3] (annotation accuracy)



First, sample the query annotations such that there is one encounter per name. 
Then, sample the database such that no daids are taken from matchable query encounters.

The experiment needs to be run once for every offset possible


python -m ibeis --tf get_annotcfg_list --db seaturtles \
    -a default:has_any=\(left\),sample_occur=True,exclude_reference=True,sample_offset=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] --acfginfo


python -m ibeis --tf get_annotcfg_list --db seaturtles \
    -a default:has_any=\(left,right\),sample_occur=True,exclude_reference=True,sample_offset=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] --acfginfo


Do we have to ing do this one query at a time?
