That's why I said "run this script and follow its directions".  :)  The 
script builds libpython2X.a, which is the hard part for most earlier Python 
versions.

This can be abrreviated -cmingw32, of course, but if you use easy_install 
it's best to update the distutils.cfg, so that it will use that compiler by 
default.

Of course, if you have a setuptools-based project you can always do this once:

    vd C:\Python27\Lib\distutils
    gvim C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py

    python setup.py build -cmingw32 saveopts -g

    python setup.py build -cmingw32 saveopts -g "--include-dirs=C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\include"

    include_dirs = ['C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\include']

    


This will update distutils.cfg automatically after running the build, to 
save any options you used on the command line in the (-g) global 
configuration.  See the "saveopts" command in the setuptools manual for 
details.  (This is one of several setuptools commands that could probably 
be non-controversial additions to the official distutils: alias, rotate, 
saveopts, and setopt.)
