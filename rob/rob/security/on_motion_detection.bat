rob speak "Hello. I am rob. Your robotic operating buddy. I welcome you to this room. If you are not my creator, don't panic. Doing nothing will only help your situation. My creator is not malicious. But he has already recieved an email with your picture. Backups will be forwarded to the police in a secret amount of time unless my creator disables this event. And he might. He expects you to replace or repair any damage you have caused. You arent totally fucked. Obviously bad shit happened to you if you are burglarizing. Sorry about that. Still, causing harm to others is not a good way to go about solving your problems. Adding pain to the world will not make yours go away. And helping can only go so far. A far better idea is to be useful or skilled. Go learn something. A trade. A talent. Use it to support yourself. Learn something to better yourself. That message is the only thing you will take away from this room. Have a splendid day. Oh, please leave your name and way to contact you so you and my creator may resolve this issue resulting from your tiny lapse of judgement. You may use the paper and pen on the bookshelf next to you. Then you will close and lock the door. If the door is broken, you must wait for my creator to return or contact you through me. You must ensure nobody else enters my room. If I know you and you aren't burglarizing, sorry about this message. I'm not smart enought to distinguish different individuals yet." -3
