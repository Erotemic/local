The ability to scale up to many thousands of images per day in a small
area and identify thousands of different animals implies that image
analysis be automated as much as possible.  Therefore, the development
and implementation of image analysis / computer vision algorithms is a
large focus of our IBEIS development.  The rapid improvements in the
literature, together with substantial redundancy of image, both in
individual encounters and over many repeated sightings, make this
substantial automation possible.
