This tutorial introduces logistic regression using Theano and stochastic  gradient descent.    Logistic regression is a probabilistic, linear classifier. It is parametrized  by a weight matrix :math:`W` and a bias vector :math:`b`. Classification is  done by projecting data points onto a set of hyperplanes, the distance to  which is used to determine a class membership probability.
